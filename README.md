# Get_next_line
This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. One of the goal of this project is to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables, and to gain a deeper understanding of allocations, whether they happen on the stack memory or in the heap memory, the manipulation and the life cycle of a buffer, the unexpected complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables.
